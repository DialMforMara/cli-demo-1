I'm hoping doing it thru Lending Club will make it easier - and cheaper - to pay off.": 1,

The lower interest rate of roughly 7% would enable me to do that.  I'm willing to share my credit report to anyone that is willing to help out. Please consider my application.  Thank you,": 1,
        " I paid off my first Prosper loan, but had an emergency and took out a second Prosper loan, but at a very high interest rate - and I would like the opportunity to get the interest rate lowered.  This loan would be used to pay off the second Prosper Loan.  ": 1,
