Description: # WhyLogs Python
        
        Python port of the [WhyLogs Java library](https://gitlab.com/whylabs/whylogs-java)
        
        ## Installation
        Currently, `python 3.7` is recommended.
        
        1. Clone the repo and cd into the directory
        2. Install with pip.
           - For a dev installation with development requirements, it's recommended to create a fresh conda environment or virtualenv
             ```
             # Development installation
             pip install -v -e ".[dev]"
             ```
           - Standard installation:
             ```
             # Standard installation
             pip install .
             ```
         
        
        ## Tests
        Testing is handled with the `pytest` framework.
        You can run all the tests by running `pytest -vvs tests/` from the parent directory.
        
        ## Scripts
        See the `scripts/` directory for some example scripts for interacting with `whylogs-python`
        
        
        # Development/contribution
        ## Doc string format
        We use the [numpydocs docstring standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), which is human-readable and works with [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) api documentation generator.
